    <p>The <strong>LORD</strong> is my <b>shepherd</b>, <em>I shall not be in want</em>. he restores my soul. He guides me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they <i>comfort me.</i></p>
